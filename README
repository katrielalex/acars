This repo contains an initial TAMARIN model for the secure ACARS
protocol in the above-linked patent. The idea is to see whether it
actually meets its guarantees, or even to decide what those guarantees
are.

If you didn't write the Makefile it probably won't work for you. The
rough instructions are:

  - `m4 secure_ACARS.m4 > proto.spthy`
  - run the Tamarin prover on `proto.spthy` however you like
